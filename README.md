# Evo-v3

Evolve artificial general intelligence through a unique agent model and training methods.

## Current Goals

- Implement a prototype version using nodes and connections
- Getting a 2D environment to evolve the agents on

## Currently Working On

- Agents evolving basic instincts to a given time based environment
- Getting a sort of memory instinct evolved

## TODO

- Species mutation
- Environment remove agent

### REMINDERS

- Don't forget to reset/initialize the agent memory after mutation/ before starting a round
